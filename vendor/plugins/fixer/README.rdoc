=  Fixer

Fixer is a light-weight Rails plugin that interfaces with the current and historical foreign exchange rate feeds provided by the European Central Bank.

It includes a generator to set up a model for the rates as well as rake tasks to populate the table.

== Usage

Generate model and migration:

  ruby script/generate fixer

Migrate.

Populate the newly-created table by running either of the following rake tasks:

  rake fixer:download:current
  rake fixer:download:history:ninety_days
  rake fixer:download:history:all

In your application, query for an exchange rate like so:

  ExchangeRate.historical('USD', 'GBP', 1.year.ago)
  => 0.65
  
  ExchangeRate.current('EUR', 'USD')
  => 1.43
  
As should be apparent, the first parameter is the base and second is the quoted currency.

This is a sparse plugin and gets the job done if this is the functionality you need.
